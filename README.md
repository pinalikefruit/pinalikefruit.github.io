# The Top 10 Attack Vectors: A Developer's Guide

This repository is an open-source, educational project dedicated to breaking down the most **critical** attack vectors and how to prevent them. The mission is to bridge the gap between complex security reports and the practical knowledge **developers** need to build safer protocols.

Inspired for [BlockThreat](https://blockthreat.io/) _DeFi Attack Vectors - Top 10 by risk_, this project provides deep-dive articles on the top attack vectors.

## What is it?

This repository contains a series of articles, each focused on a single, high-impact attack vector. You can read the published articles on the website: [**https://attackvectors.org/**](https://www.attackvectors.org/)

We move beyond complex and lengthy explanations to provide an easy-to-understand and complete resource for developers, built on insights from security experts.

Each article follows this structure:

#### What is [Attack Vector]?
*   A clear, concise definition of the vulnerability in plain English.
*   An explanation of the root cause.
*   A **Real-World Impact** section detailing a real-world case.

#### How the Attack Works
*   A step-by-step breakdown of the attacker's playbook.
*   Vulnerable code snippets and conceptual diagrams.
*   An explanation of the underlying technical mechanics.

#### How to Prevent It
*   Actionable, code-level mitigation strategies.
*   Best practices and design patterns.
