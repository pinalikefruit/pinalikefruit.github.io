# What is a Stolen Private Key Attack?

A Stolen Private Key attack is the unauthorized acquisition of the cryptographic key that controls a blockchain account (EOA) or has privileged access to a smart contract system. This is not a smart contract vulnerability; it is a catastrophic operational security (OPSEC) failure. Once an attacker possesses a private key, they have absolute control over the associated address. They can sign any transaction, drain all funds, and execute any privileged function without needing to exploit a single line of code.
